 * @class SystemProcessors

 * @details We've found that using java's Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() utility does
 *     not always accurately reflect the amount of processors available. In some cases it returns 1
 *     due to containerization or virtualization. For example, if you are using k8s with containerd
 *     you might see this method give back 1 based on your particular deployment. There are other
 *     implementations such as OSHI that use JNA to acquire the native operating system and hardware
 *     information which is often more suitable for buildfarm. In order to provide consistency in
 *     deriving configuration values, and allocating thread pools, it's best to source the processor
 *     count from the same place. This abstracts implementation on how we derive processor count
 *     based on config and environment.
