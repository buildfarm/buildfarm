An access for the entry is inserted into the Access Queue. A read is (currently) impermeable to expiration, and can result in overcharge of filesystem content in such a case. Write(id): The CFC provides a Write-interface object that can be used to insert content into the CAS. Service and Operation lifetime implementations use this to inject content as requested, and leverage its restartable and asynchronous completion capacities. Writes may be rejected out of hand due to configurable CAS entry size limitations. Under the hood, there are several constraints present per-write: . | A Write is uniquely identified by its digest and a uuid. | A Write will charge the storage pool size with its full content size upon opening a stream via getOutput(). | A Write’s OutputStream is a mutually exclusive transaction, with a premature close() restoring the stream’s capacity for representation. | A close() upon completion of a Write’s OutputStream will initiate a validation for it. | Upon successful validation (size and content are compared to the expected digest), a commit is effected, making it available as a CAS entry with a recorded access placing it at the head of the RC-LRU. | Within a CFC, concurrent Writes to a single digest will compete for completion, with the first one to commit cancelling all other Writes’ OutputStreams to the same digest. | Upon a commit, a shared future for all Writes to a single digest is completed, allowing premature indication of committed content receipt. | . FindMissingBlobs(digests): The process index is queried for each requested digest with executable impartiality, to filter for only those entries that do not exist in the index. No file interactions take place during this request, and no invalidation of content occurs upon this request. Accesses for all existing entries enter the Access Queue. Batch Read/Write: These requests are sequenced for each entry, resulting in only latency reduction, corresponding to each individual operation. ",

Entries are either in or out of the RC-LRU, with only those entries in the RC-LRU considered for expiration. All entries with reference counts &gt; 0 are out of the RC-LRU. Manipulation of the RC-LRU is synchronized for the entire CFC, with the actors being the transactive put[Directory]() and decrementReferences() methods, as well as the Access Recorder. Directory Index . Directories can be maintained by the CFC to provide several important heuristic optimizations, both in terms of storage and IO complexity. For a given directory entry, a key of its digest is used to refer to all of its flattened content digests. This is complemented by a filesystem directory named for the digest with a &lt;hash&gt;_dir name, where it will contain a) real directories underneath it named for each level of DirectoryNode in its REAPI specification, and b) files with names and executability from a FileNode for each Directory’s files, the inodes for which are all CAS entry files (or empty files, in that special size case). The CFC also maintains a reverse index for each CAS entry to all of the directories it exists under. Upon expiration of an entry, each directory it is contained in is also expired, with both Directory Index and filesystem directories being deleted.

Entry and Directory metadata content Time To Live checks provide convergent consistency in the event of asynchronous filesystem manipulation - in the event of an unexpected availability or permission change to the filesystem, the CFC eventually discovers and presents corrected state. Expiration . As a result of any intended insertion into the CFC, the total content size of the CAS is ‘charged’ by adding the size of the new content. A test is performed against this size. If the size exceeds a configurable maximum content size, expiration occurs and blocks the insertion until complete. To expire content, the CFC removes the tail of the RC-LRU, attempts a delegate write if configured, expires its associated directories, removes its metadata, deletes its file content, and will executable-impartially invoke a callback with the expired digest. This process is repeated until the size is once again below the maximum content size. Delegation . The CFC supports a waterfall delegation to a CAS Interface Object. This Object (currently) sees the following interactions: . | Writes upon expirations of a referencing CFC, with full output streaming. | Reads upon content missing from a referencing CFC, with read through insertion of the referencing CFC as an entry | FindMissingBlobs for filtered entries that remain missing from a referencing CFC. | .

This documentation presents it both in terms of functional behavior, as if it were a service or process, as well as with Java semantics, owing to its implementation. A CFC has the additional responsibility in shard workers of presenting a CAS (Java) Interface, which supports the typical Read, Write, FindMissingBlobs, and batch versions of the R/W requests. Each CFC needs a filesystem path to use as its root, and a set of configuration parameters. Under this path, it will store the CAS entries, named by their digests, optionally in a partitioned directory hierarchy by subdividing the first N bytes of the hash. The CAS entries are treated by the CFC in terms of their index (filesystem directory) mapping to an inode (file content and limited metadata). This is an important distinction for the CFC, as it is used to present a substantially deduplicated ephemeral tree of inputs by its corresponding Exec Filesystem when executing actions.

    "content": "TL;DR: BwoB is supported by Buildfarm. Build with --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=5. As proposed in this issue and the accompanying document, bazel endeavors to provide a mechanism to be ‘content-light’ for remote execution, using only content reference addresses to request action execution and construct successively dependent action definitions. Builds Without The Bytes skips the download of action output files until it needs them. Bazel now (&gt;= 7) also applies a wall-clock ttl to every action result it downloads, depending upon current settings. See bazel documentation for the default. If this ttl has not expired, regardless of bazel daemon uptime, the remote cache will not be queried for an action result. The stored ActionResult also has no source - if you switch bazel --remote_cache or --remote_executor targets inside of the ttl, bazel will blindly assume the current target has ActionResult contents. If ActionResult contents expire on Buildfarm, when bazel requests them, it will fail, hopefully with the special REMOTE_CACHE_EVICTED (39) exit code. The flag --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries will cause bazel to restart a build with no intervention required, for the specified limit # of times. Buildfarm (since 2.11) defaults to ensureOutputsPresent: true in server configs. When bazel requests an ActionResult, it will be NOT_FOUND (cache miss) unless all of its contents exist in the CAS. This also extends the lifetime of those contents (without shard loss) to the minimum ttl before expiration. With ensureOutputsPresent: false, there is also a mechanism to control this check on a per-request level. The REAPI presents a ‘correlated_invocations_id’ in the RequestMetadata settable on headers for every request to BuildFarm, including the GetActionResult request, which it uses to retrieve cached results. BuildFarm recognizes this correlated_invocations_id and if it is a URI, can parse its query parameters for behavior control. One such control is ENSURE_OUTPUTS_PRESENT for the GetActionResult request - if this query value is the string “true”, BuildFarm will make a silent FindMissingBlobs check for all of the outputs of an ActionResult before responding with it. If any are missing, BuildFarm will instead return code NOT_FOUND, inspiring the client to see a cache miss, and attempt a [remote] execution. ",

Example: . worker: capabilities: cas: true execution: true . Sandbox Settings . Using the sandbox can be configurable by the client via exec_properties. However, sometimes it is preferred to enable it via buildfarm config to prevent users from running actions outside the sandbox. | Configuration | Accepted and Default Values | Description | . | alwaysUseSandbox | boolean, false | Whether or not to always use the sandbox when running actions. It may be preferred to enforce sandbox usage than rely on client selection. | . | alwaysUseAsNobody | boolean, false | Whether or not to always use the as-nobody wrapper when running actions.

Otherwise, there may be no alternative solution and the “tmpfs” request will be ignored / implemented differently. | . Example: . worker: sandboxSettings: alwaysUseSandbox: true alwaysUseAsNobody: false alwaysUseCgroups: true alwaysUseTmpFs: true additionalWritePaths: [] tmpFsPaths: [] selectForBlockNetwork: false selectForTmpFs: false . Note: In order for these settings to take effect, you must also configure limitGlobalExecution: true. Dequeue Match . | Configuration | Accepted and Default Values | Description | . | allowUnmatched | boolean, false |   | . | properties | List of name/value pairs | Pairs of provisions available to match against action properties | . Example: . worker: dequeueMatchSettings: allowUnmatched: false properties: - name: \"gpu\" value: \"nvidia RTX 2090\" . Resources . A list of limited resources that are available to the worker to be depleted by actions which execute containing a “resource:\": \"N\" property. The dequeueMatchSettings may also further limit executions to contain \"resource:\" in properties, with either a specific limited resource count as the only accepted value for the action property. The use case here is one where executions are not allowed to request any value other than the one specified. There are no operators currently for asserting an execution requests 'less than' a particular number of resources. The default resource type is SEMAPHORE. The expected use case is that a resource is internally allocated and managed by an execution, and the exhaustion prevents executions from starting which would block or fault if they could not consume the resource. Common examples include licensed software with tokens, and this mechanism can work for singleton resources like one gpu on a worker. The POOL resource type is intended for externally defined resource allotment. The Integer range [0,amount) will be created in a pool of free ids provided to The common use case here is multiple gpus on a system, where the concurrent execution on all gpus can take place, but each execution completion frees a different gpu that must be targetted with, for example, the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES env var. The pool takes a resource out of a queue of available ids, and replaces it in the queue when the execution is complete. Since externally defined resources need to be injected into an execution, the depletion of a pool resource applies an automatic execution policy, named ‘pool-', and supplies transformations for both '' - expanded to all ids in multiple arguments, or '' for 0-N addressable ids, up to the amount requested. Subsequent literal arguments can provide a delimiter for the wrapper. | Configuration | Accepted and Default Values | Description | . | name | string | Resource identifier present on worker | . | type | SEMAPHORE, POOL | Resource count depleted by actions | . | amount | Integer | Resource count depleted by actions | . Example: . worker: dequeueMatchSettings: properties: - name: \"resource:special-compiler-license\" value: \"1\" # only actions which request one compiler license at a time will be accepted resources: name: \"special-compiler-license\" amount: 3 . Worker CAS . Unless specified, options are only relevant for FILESYSTEM type . | Configuration | Accepted and Default Values | Description | . | type | FILESYSTEM, GRPC | Type of CAS used | . | path | String, cache | Local cache location relative to the ‘root’, or absolute | . | maxSizeBytes | Integer, 0 | Limit for contents of files retained from CAS in the cache, value of 0 means to auto-configure to 90% of root/path underlying filesystem space | . | fileDirectoriesIndexInMemory | boolean, false | Determines if the file directories bidirectional mapping should be stored in memory or in sqlite | . | skipLoad | boolean, false | Determines if transient data on the worker should be loaded into CAS on worker startup (affects startup time) | . | target | String, null | For GRPC CAS type, target for external CAS endpoint | . Example: . This definition will create a filesystem-based CAS file cache at the path “/cache\" on the worker that will reject entries over 2GiB in size, and will expire LRU blobs when the aggregate size of all blobs exceeds 2GiB in order to insert additional entries. worker: storages: - type: FILESYSTEM path: \"cache\" maxSizeBytes: 2147483648 # 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 . This definition elides FILESYSTEM configuration with ‘…’, will read-through an external GRPC CAS supporting the REAPI CAS Services into its storage, and will attempt to write expiring entries into the GRPC CAS (i.e. pushing new entries into the head of a worker LRU list will drop the entries from the tail into the GRPC CAS). worker: storages: - type: FILESYSTEM ... - type: GRPC target: \"cas.external.com:1234\" . Execution Policies . | Configuration | Accepted and Default Values | Description | . | name | String | Execution policy name | . | prioritized | Boolean, false | If true, policy will run before built-in policies | . | executionWrapper | Execution wrapper, containing a path and list of arguments | Execution wrapper, its path and a list of arguments for the wrapper | . Example: . worker: executionPolicies: - name: as-nobody prioritized: true executionWrapper: path: /app/build_buildfarm/as-nobody arguments: - \"-u\" - \"&lt;exec-owner&gt;\" - name: unshare executionWrapper: path: /usr/bin/unshare arguments: - \"-n\" - \"-r\" - name: linux-sandbox executionWrapper: path: /app/build_buildfarm/linux-sandbox arguments: # use \"--\" to signal the end of linux-sandbox args. \"--\" should always be last! - \"--\" - name: test executionWrapper: path: /YOUR/WRAPPER arguments: - arg1 - arg2 - \"&lt;platform-property-name&gt;\" . arg1 and arg2 are interpreted literally. &lt;platform-property-value&gt; will be substituted with the value of a property named \"platform-property-name\" from a Command’s Platform or the requested pool resources for the execution. If a matching property or pool resource is not found for a specified name, the entire wrapper will be discarded and have no effect on the execution. &lt;exec-owner&gt; is an automatically provided pool resource when execOwner or execOwners is specified, and will contain the value of the execution’s owner selected for exec tree creation. An execution with as-nobody, unshare, and linux-sandbox execution policies enabled would produce a command line like: . /app/build_buildfarm/as-nobody -u &lt;exec-owner&gt; /usr/bin/unshare -n -r /app/build_buildfarm/linux-sandbox -- /YOUR/WRAPPER arg1 arg2 &lt;platform-property-name&gt; ACTION . where ACTION is the Command from remote execution action.

Writes should respect a WriteResponse received at any time after initiating the request of the size of the blob, to indicate that no further WriteRequests are necessary. Writes which fail prior to the receipt of content should be progressive, checking for the offset to resume an upload via ByteStream QueryWriteStatus. Buildfarm implements the CAS in a variety of ways, including an in-memory storage for the reference implementation, as a proxy for an external CAS, an HTTP/1 proxy based on the remote-cache implementation in bazel, and as a persistent on-disk storage for workers, supplementing an execution filesystem for actions as well as participating in a sparsely-sharded distributed store.

Since the worker maintains a large cache of inputs for use with actions, this CAS is routinely populated from downloads due to operation input fetches in addition to uploads from the Shard frontend. CasFileCache . The worker’s CAS file cache uses persistent disk storage. A strongly recommended filesystem to back this is XFS, due to its high link counts limits per inode. A strongly discouraged filesystem is ext4, which places a hard limit of 65000 link counts per inode. The layout of the files are ordered such that file content, in the form of canonical digest filenames for inode storage, remains on the root of the cache directory, while exec roots and symlinkable directories contain hard links to these inodes. This avoids unnecessary duplication of file contents. Upon worker startup, the worker’s cache instance is initialized in two phases. First, the root is scanned to store file information. Second, the existing directories are traversed to compute their validating identification. Files will be automatically deleted if their file names are invalid for the cache, or if the configured cache size has been exceeded by previous files. The shard worker allows a flexible specification, with delegates available of the other types to fall back on for CAS expansion, and encapsulated CAS configs . CASTest is a standalone tool to load the cache and print status information about it. ",

    "doc": "Debugging",
    "title": "Debugging Executions",
    "content": "This tutorial is intended to guide you in debugging executions that are run on buildfarm. Problem . Build actions (and more specifically unit tests) often behave differently across environments. This makes it difficult to understand and debug remote action behavior. The execution environment of buildfarm may seem like an inaccessible black-box to the client. The problem is further complicated by the fact that buildfarm’s executor may not be using the same tools locally as the build system (such as bazel’s sandbox or process-wrapper). In buildfarm, these tools are chosen based on the configuration of execution wrappers, and custom execution wrappers exist as well. Buildfarm may also virtualize hardware and apply restrictions on resources such as cpu, memory, and network. Additionally, buildfarm actions do not always run on the same machine. Actions in buildfarm are directed to particular eligible workers based on their platform properties. Despite the platform properties of the worker chosen, the action may run inside a docker container which also affects the execution environment. Capturing debug information (before execution) . There are execution properties available to help you capture debug information dynamically when performing executions. To capture initial information about an execution, you can use the following: . bazel test --remote_default_exec_properties='debug-before-execution=true' \\ --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:8980 \\ --noremote_accept_cached \\ --nocache_test_results //&lt;TARGET&gt; . Assuming the action is properly queued and reaches the executor, the executor will deliberately fail the action and send you debug information via json through the action’s stderr. You can view this debug information by reading the failure log: . cat source/bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/testlogs/&lt;TARGET&gt;/test.log . You can streamline viewing this information via --test_output=streamed . bazel test \\ --test_output=streamed \\ --remote_default_exec_properties='debug-before-execution=true' \\ --noremote_accept_cached \\ --nocache_test_results \\ //&lt;TARGET&gt; . Capturing debug information (after execution) . A similar property exists that will tell the executor to run the action, and after the action finishes, return debug information. bazel test \\ --test_output=streamed \\ --remote_default_exec_properties='debug-after-execution=true' \\ --noremote_accept_cached \\ --nocache_test_results \\ //&lt;TARGET&gt; . If your action is hanging, you might not be able to get this debug information and should stick with ‘debug-before-execution=true’. If your action is finishing, this would be a ideal to use, as it should provide all the same information that ‘debug-before-execution=true’ does, with additional info about the execution. Configuration . If you see an error like this: . properties are not valid for queue eligibility: [name: \"debug-before-execution\" value: \"true\"] . you will need to configure the queue’s allow_unmatched to true so that the server can still put the action on the queue. Additionally you may want to configure the worker’s DequeueMatchSettings to also have allow_unmatched to true. That will ensure the action does not fail reaching one of the worker due to the additional exec_property. Debugging Tests . By default, debug-before-execution and debug-after-execution only apply to test actions. The reason being, is that if you wanted to debug a test, but passed a global property like --remote_default_exec_properties='debug-before-execution=true', it would invalidate all the actions, and the test would need rebuilt, but the rebuild of the test would fail, because you would actually be debugging the first build action, and you would never see the debug results of the test action. Debugging tests is more typical, but you can also debug build actions by using --remote_default_exec_properties='debug-tests-only=false'. It is more convenient to debug things by passing the global exec properties, but you could also tag targets specifically in the BUILD files with these debug options. Finding Operations . All buildfarm operations can be found using the following query: . bazel run //src/main/java/build/buildfarm:bf-find-operations localhost:8980 shard SHA256 . When you run a build invocation with bazel, bazel will you give you an invocation id. You can use that to query your specific operations: . bazel run //src/main/java/build/buildfarm:bf-find-operations localhost:8980 shard SHA256 \"[?(@.operation.metadata.requestMetadata.toolInvocationId == '1877f43a-9b33-4eca-9d6b-aef71b47bf47')]\" . You can find the operation of a specific test name like this: . bazel run //src/main/java/build/buildfarm:bf-find-operations localhost:8980 shard SHA256 \"$.command.environmentVariables[?(@.value == '//code/tools/example_tests/bash_hello_world2:main')]\" .

    "content": "Since workers are expected to execute programs in a way that makes using remote transparent to build users, there is a great deal of nuance to their definition. Operating System, Distribution, runtimes, compilers, their versions, and standard libraries make this a tricky proposition. While hermeticizing a build by declaring the full set of tools a compilation requires is the ‘right’ solution for a build, it may be too big of a hill to climb for everyone, particularly those trying to ease into remote execution. Under Linux at least, this is made somewhat easier through docker, even if the steps to get to a conformant environment are a bit complicated. Here we will provide an example of creating a target execution environment container capable of running buildfarm, and this should be similar for all major distributions, particularly those with released docker hub bases and standard package managers including java runtimes and toolchain software. You should choose the versions of relevant software at first based on the client environment you want to support. For this example, we’re going to assume a target of ubuntu-20 (focal), with a gcc9 compiler supporting C++, and a java runtime from openjdk-14 supplied by its package manager. We will need: . | a bazel 3.3.1 install (the older version is required by rules_docker at the buildfarm version, this will be updated eventually). | docker daemon running | . First we will pull our intended base image from dockerhub: . docker pull ubuntu:focal . Next we will create our Dockerfile for our customized environment. Here is the content of that Dockerfile . # choose our ubuntu distribution with version 20 (focal) from ubuntu:focal # get our current software suite. apt-get is preferred to apt due to warnings # about a non-stable CLI run apt-get update # install the basic apt-utils to limit warnings due to its absence run DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --no-install-suggests apt-utils # upgrade to the current software suite versions run DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get dist-upgrade -y # install the required packages for our execution environment and buildfarm runtime run DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-suggests \\ g++-9 g++ openjdk-14-jdk-headless . And build it with docker build -t ubuntu20-java14:latest . Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.56kB Step 1/5 : from ubuntu:focal ---&gt; 9140108b62dc ... Removing intermediate container 505236be00e4 ---&gt; 77a8c2ae4d16 Successfully built 77a8c2ae4d16 Successfully tagged ubuntu20-java14:latest . In our example’s case, we want to use this image as a base to build a buildfarm worker container image. Unfortunately, rules_docker does not know how to interact with the docker images hosted by a local docker daemon, only docker registries like dockerhub.io. We will get past this by running the local registry utility container. If you really want to host this base elsewhere, I’ll assume that you know how to translate the host:port references below, and you can skip running your own registry. First we need to tag our image so that it gets pushed to our local registry: . docker tag ubuntu20-java14:latest localhost.localdomain:5000/ubuntu20-java14:latest . Then we can start our registry with a recognizable name for later shutdown: . docker run -d --rm --name local-registry -p 5000:5000 registry . And push our newly tagged image: . docker push localhost.localdomain:5000/ubuntu20-java14:latest . Take note of the sha256:&lt;sha256sum&gt; output that was produced with this command, as we will need to use it to specify our base. Now we have a referent docker image that can be identified as a base to apply buildfarm’s worker installation onto. In a suitable location, create a WORKSPACE containing: . load(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\") BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_COMMIT = \"04fc2635f5546a4f5dc19dea35bb1fca5569ce24\" BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_SHA256 = \"f45215ef075c8aff230b737ca3bc5ba183c1137787fcbbb10dd407463f76edb6\" http_archive( name = \"build_buildfarm\", strip_prefix = \"bazel-buildfarm-%s\" % BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_COMMIT, sha256 = BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_SHA256, url = \"https://github.com/buildfarm/buildfarm/archive/%s.zip\" % BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_COMMIT, ) load(\"@build_buildfarm//:deps.bzl\", \"buildfarm_dependencies\") buildfarm_dependencies() load(\"@build_buildfarm//:defs.bzl\", \"buildfarm_init\") buildfarm_init() load(\"@io_bazel_rules_docker//repositories:deps.bzl\", container_deps = \"deps\") load(\"@io_bazel_rules_docker//container:container.bzl\", \"container_pull\") container_deps() container_pull( name = \"ubuntu20_java14_image_base\", digest = \"sha256:&lt;sha256sum&gt;\", registry = \"localhost:5000\", repository = \"ubuntu20-java14\", ) . Be sure to substitute the sha256:&lt;sha256sum&gt; with your content from above. Next we will create a BUILD file to create our target image. We will use the shard variant here, but the memory worker (with supporting server execution) will work as well. The content of the BUILD file should be: . load(\"@io_bazel_rules_docker//container:container.bzl\", \"container_image\") container_image( name = \"buildfarm-shard-worker-ubuntu20-java14\", base = \"@ubuntu20_java14_image_base//image\", files = [ \"@build_buildfarm//src/main/java/build/buildfarm:buildfarm-shard-worker_deploy.jar\", ], ) . And now that this is in place, we can use the following to build the container and make it available to our local docker daemon: . bazel run :buildfarm-shard-worker-ubuntu20-java14 . ",

Other limiting fields also require this option to be enabled. This does not mandate that all executions take place in this created cgroup. If true, the boolean configuration field limit_global_execution specifies that all executions take place in the above cgroup by default. This currently shrinks the effective cpu area available to be shared by all executions to the width of the execute stage. With limit_execution enabled, a Command may request that it be executed with min-cores available to it (lower bound) and up to max-cores. These are field names in the Platform which are expected to be integers in the string value. After selective consumption of the superscalar execution slots for min-cores, the executing processes will be controlled by cgroups under the above cgroup to give it as many shares of the total (preferred scheduling) for min-cores, and have its scheduling quota limited to a fair number consistent with its max-cores. The effective Platform of an execution can also be affected by the Worker’s default_platform, where it can inherit either of min/max-cores if unspecified. The Worker configuration field only_multicore_tests can further affect the values of min/max-cores by clamping them to 1 if enabled, based on the detection of ‘bazel-like’ test environments for executions: The detection of an environment variable XML_OUTPUT_FILE under the command is the current qualifier .

Changing code or using --action_env may be less feasible than specifying them through these exec_properties. Additionally, the values of their environment variables may need to be influenced by buildfarm decisions. example: pytorch tests can still see the underlying hardware through /proc/cpuinfo. Despite being given 1 core, they see all of the cpus and decide to spawn that many threads. This essentially starves them and gives poor test performance (we may spoof cpuinfo in the future).

A Tool Invocation is an organization of all requests made by a client during one logical user invocation. For instance, bazel, as a tool, will generate a UUID per invocation, usually by a user or CI script - e.g: each time you run bazel, it generates internally and uses a different toolInvocationId, making this a collection of Executions (and other requests) per run. A set of Correlated Invocations is uniquely identified by another UUID, the correlatedInvocationsId, which is expected to encompass one or more Tool Invocations. A build tool will provide the mechanism to specify this by a user - e.g: each time you run bazel, you can specify the same --build_request_id to indicate that a run is a member of a collection of Tool Invocations. The correlatedInvocationsId must be a string that ends with an 8-4-4-4-12 format UUID string (important because this value is completely specified by a client user), otherwise it is ignored and buildfarm will emit a warning.

Buildfarm has taken steps that make it beneficial to provide this information as a URI. The fragment of the URI is an excellent place to specify the required trailing UUID. For example, our archetypal builder “Alice” provided this: . https://alice@dev-workstation/projects/winthorp/modules/interpreter?org=database&amp;milestone=epsilon#fda159f2-bafe-4270-91ba-c7a946c0f2ba . She’s specified a userinfo containing her username (the password field of userinfo will be ignored by buildfarm), the host the build ran on, a path that identified her project and its module per her organization, which is listed here as database, and she’s clearly working on the ‘epsilon’ milestone. Trailing it after a fragment separator is the required uuid. A single layer of optional indexing is provided in buildfarm to collect Correlated Invocations with useful identifying information. The indexing starts with the configuration of buildfarm’s server: . server: ... correlatedInvocationsIndexScopes: !!set ? host ? username . This means that the host and username fields should be indexed for correlatedInvocationsIds observed. This configuration is the default, and you may remove or add any indexing you wish. These values are extracted from the correlatedInvocationsId on every request, and must not differ in content contained within the URI without also changing the UUID, in order to guarantee proper indexing. Any values other than the above will be extracted from the query of the URI - host will come from the component in authority, and username from userinfo. These will create indices which identify correlatedInvocations via the UUID portion of the correlatedInvocationsId, making this a series of collections of correlatedInvocations . ",

In the interest of a speedy response, the Operations it returns will not have any details other than name populated. More detailed information about a name returned can be queried with getOperation. The listOperations response can then be considered a list of names for these examples. The ListOperationsRequest name and filter fields have several special meanings intended for discovery. The instance name listed here will be solomon for identification purposes. ListOperationsRequest({ name: \"solomon\", }) . Will yield the names of the indices and special bindings. In the case of the above, after running a build with the above correlatedInvocationsId and configuration: . executions toolInvocations correlatedInvocations host username . To discover the available correlatedInvocations index entries for username: . ListOperationsRequest({ name: \"solomon/username\", }) . Which will yield: . username=alice username=bob username=mallory . For a system where usernames alice, bob, and mallory have been presented in correlatedInvocationsId URIs. To see the correlatedInvocationsIds for mallory, we can switch to a filter and select the correlatedInvocations parent resource: . ListOperationsRequest({ name: \"solomon/correlatedInvocations\", filter: \"username=mallory\", }) . Note that the format is the same as the one in the output of the index entries result. This yields: . 0c1ce9e6-471d-4265-b15b-885e42670fdb 7bd7f8d2-6628-4f3f-a7e3-9eff917eb697 6ca27615-4fb5-4ffc-9349-d484926bd05e . So username=mallory is associated with these three correlatedInvocations. These are correlatedInvocationsIds which can be passed to the toolInvocations parent resource: . ListOperationsRequest({ name: \"solomon/toolInvocations\", filter: \"correlatedInvocationId=0c1ce9e6-471d-4265-b15b-885e42670fdb\", }) . To get a list of toolInvocationIds: . fad33d5e-fbba-483d-8df4-4502621caff2 44e516cd-d8fd-4c61-90d2-9389402242a4 . This correlatedInvocationId was used in two client invocations. Our last stop on the hierarchy is to pass this to the executions binding associated with its toolInvocationId: . ListOperationsRequest({ name: \"solomon/executions\", filter: \"toolInvocationId=fad33d5e-fbba-483d-8df4-4502621caff2\", }) . This yields a huge list of the names of executions that the toolInvocation fad33d5e-fbba-483d-8df4-4502621caff2 requested via the Execute method. The Operation-encapsulated information from these execution UUID results can be retrieved via getOperation with a name of solomon/executions/&lt;uuid&gt;.

    "title": "Working with different platform requirements",
    "content": "Some operations’ Actions may have specific platform requirements in order to execute. Likewise, specific workers may only want to take on work that they deem eligible. To solve this, the operation queue can be customized to divide work into separate provisioned queues so that specific workers can choose which queue to read from. Provision queues are intended to represent particular operations that should only be processed by particular workers. An example use case for this would be to have two dedicated provision queues for CPU and GPU operations. CPU/GPU requirements would be determined through the remote api’s command platform properties. We designate provision queues to have a set of “required provisions” (which match the platform properties). This allows the scheduler to distribute operations by their properties and allows workers to dequeue from particular queues. If your configuration file does not specify any provisioned queues, buildfarm will automatically provide a default queue with full eligibility on all operations. This will ensure the expected behavior for the paradigm in which all work is put on the same queue. Matching Algorithm . The matching algorithm is performed by the operation queue when the server or worker is requesting to push or pop elements, respectively. The matching algorithm is designed to find the appropriate queue to perform these actions on. On the scheduler side, the action’s platform properties are used for matching. On the worker side, the dequeue_match_settings are used. The matching algorithm works as follows: Each provision queue is checked in the order that it is configured. The first provision queue that is deemed eligible is chosen and used. When deciding if an action is eligible for the provision queue, each platform property is checked individually. By default, there must be a perfect match on each key/value. Wildcards (“*”) can be used to avoid the need of a perfect match. Additionally, if the action contains any platform properties is not mentioned by the provision queue, it will be deemed ineligible. setting allowUnmatched: true can be used to allow a superset of action properties as long as a subset matches the provision queue. If no provision queues can be matched, the operation queue will provide an analysis on why none of the queues were eligible. A worker will dequeue operations from matching queues and determine whether to keep and execute it according to the following procedure: For each property key-value in the operation’s platform, an operation is REJECTED if: The key is min-cores and the integer value is greater than the number of cores on the worker. Or The key is min-mem and the integer value is greater than the number of bytes of RAM on the worker. Or if the key exists in the DequeueMatchSettings platform with neither the value nor a * in the corresponding DMS platform key’s values, Or if the allowUnmatched setting is false. For each resource requested in the operation’s platform with the resource: prefix, the action is rejected if: The resource amount cannot currently be satisfied with the associated resource capacity count . There are special predefined execution property names which resolve to dynamic configuration for the worker to match against: Worker: The worker’s publicName min-cores: Less than or equal to the executeStageWidth process-wrapper: The set of named process-wrappers present in configuration . Server Example . In this example the scheduler declares a GPU queue and CPU queue. All queues must be declared for the server deployment: . backplane: queues: - name: \"cpu\" allowUnmatched: true properties: - name: \"min-cores\" value: \"*\" - name: \"max-cores\" value: \"*\" - name: \"gpu\" allowUnmatched: true properties: - name: \"gpu\" value: \"1\" . Worker Example . Queues are defined similarly on Workers. Only the specific worker type queue must be declared for that specific worker deployment. For example, for a CPU worker pool use: . backplane: queues: - name: \"cpu\" allowUnmatched: true properties: - name: \"min-cores\" value: \"*\" - name: \"max-cores\" value: \"*\" . For example, for a GPU worker pool use: . backplane: queues: - name: \"gpu\" allowUnmatched: true properties: - name: \"gpu\" value: \"1\" . Note: make sure that all workers can communicate with each other before trying these examples . Bazel Perspective . Bazel targets can pass these platform properties to buildfarm via exec_properties. Here is for example how to run a remote build for the GPU queue example above: . bazel build --remote_executor=grpc://server:port --remote_default_exec_properties=gpu=1 //... ",

    "content": "A Buildfarm cluster can be used strictly as an ActionCache (AC) and ContentAddressableStorage (CAS) to improve build performance. This is an example of running a bazel client that will retrieve results if available, otherwise store them on a cache miss after executing locally. Download the buildfarm repository and change into its directory, then: . | run bazel run src/main/java/build/buildfarm:buildfarm-server $PWD/examples/config.minimal.yml | . This will wait while the server runs, indicating that it is ready for requests. A server alone does not itself store the content of action results. It acts as an endpoint for any number of workers that present storage, so we must also start a single worker. From another prompt (i.e. a separate terminal) in the buildfarm repository directory: . | run bazel run src/main/java/build/buildfarm:buildfarm-shard-worker -- --prometheus_port=9091 $PWD/examples/config.minimal.yml | . The -- option is bazel convention to treat all subsequent arguments as parameters to the running app, like our --prometheus_port, instead of interpreting them with run The --prometheus_port=9091 option allows this worker to run alongside our server, who will have started and logged that it has started a service on port 9090. You can also turn this option off (with -- separator), with --prometheus_option=0 for either server or worker. This will also wait while the worker runs, indicating it will be available to store cache content. From another prompt in your newly created workspace directory from above: . | run bazel clean | run bazel run --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:8980 :main | . Why do we clean here? Since we’re verifying re-execution and caching, this ensures that we will execute any actions in the run step and interact with the remote cache. We should be attempting to retrieve cached results, and then when we miss - since we just started this memory resident server - bazel will upload the results of the execution for later use. There will be no change in the output of this bazel run if everything worked, since bazel does not provide output each time it uploads results. To prove that we have placed something in the action cache, we need to do the following: . | run bazel clean | run bazel run --remote_cache=grpc://localhost:8980 :main | . This should now print statistics on the processes line that indicate that you’ve retrieved results from the cache for your actions: . INFO: 2 processes: 2 remote cache hit. ",

Use https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/main/doc/statuscodes.md to reference these until tools_remote can print a nicer representation. Also included in each call is the timestamp of the call, its final response, and for streaming calls, some information about how the call proceeded through retries and progressive activity. There is also RequestMetadata information printed for each request to indicate which correlated build id, build id, and action a call is associated with. The action is consistent across all of the requests for a single action, and is vital to group the disparate calls within a log to the same action context. It also helps to establish an expected flow of the sequence of calls. You will see some (or none) of the following Calls in this log file: . Capabilities::GetCapabilities - asking the remote service what is supported. ActionCache::GetActionResult - a call to the action cache service to retrieve an action result. This takes a ‘digest key’, a hex number whose size depends on your hash policy, likely the default SHA256, packaged with the size of the original content, looking something like a948904f2f0f479b8f8197694b30184b0d2ed1c1cd2a1ec0fb85d299a192a447/42. The responses, if successful, will contain the results of an action execution, and constitute a cache HIT. A NOT_FOUND status response corresponds to a cache MISS. ByteStream::Read - Each one of these is a download for a digest that, very likely, was reported in an action result. These likewise use digests in their resource_names, and if you correspond the digest in a Read to a digest in an Action Result, you will learn the name of a file being downloaded. ContentAddressableStorage::FindMissingBlob - The client is likely asking the remote system which of a set of digests does NOT exist in the CAS. An empty response means that everything is present remotely already. Any blobs returned will need to be uploaded by the client. You can find the action key in this set, at a minimum. This call occurs before any uploads of content, because it drives those calls, within an action’s context. ByteStream::Write - Each of these is an upload for a digest that, very likely, was returned in a FindMissingBlobs response. Digests are in their resource_names again, with an additional uuid to indicate a particular client’s upload of a file. Execution Execute - this is the call that directs the remote execution system to execute an action. Each response will be listed as the execution moves through one of several states on the remote side, likely culminating in COMPLETED. Note that this does not mean a successful execution, only that an operation is done executing, and now has its exit status, and outputs, if any, available for download in the CAS. ",

    "content": "Since workers are expected to execute programs in a way that makes using remote transparent to build users, there is a great deal of nuance to their definition. Operating System, Distribution, runtimes, compilers, their versions, and standard libraries make this a tricky proposition. While hermeticizing a build by declaring the full set of tools a compilation requires is the ‘right’ solution for a build, it may be too big of a hill to climb for everyone, particularly those trying to ease into remote execution. Under Linux at least, this is made somewhat easier through docker, even if the steps to get to a conformant environment are a bit complicated. Here we will provide an example of creating a target execution environment container capable of running buildfarm, and this should be similar for all major distributions, particularly those with released docker hub bases and standard package managers including java runtimes and toolchain software. You should choose the versions of relevant software at first based on the client environment you want to support. For this example, we’re going to assume a target of ubuntu-20 (focal), with a gcc9 compiler supporting C++, and a java runtime from openjdk-14 supplied by its package manager. We will need: . | a bazel 3.3.1 install (the older version is required by rules_docker at the buildfarm version, this will be updated eventually). | docker daemon running | . First we will pull our intended base image from dockerhub: . docker pull ubuntu:focal . Next we will create our Dockerfile for our customized environment. Here is the content of that Dockerfile . # choose our ubuntu distribution with version 20 (focal) from ubuntu:focal # get our current software suite. apt-get is preferred to apt due to warnings # about a non-stable CLI run apt-get update # install the basic apt-utils to limit warnings due to its absence run DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --no-install-suggests apt-utils # upgrade to the current software suite versions run DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get dist-upgrade -y # install the required packages for our execution environment and buildfarm runtime run DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-suggests \\ g++-9 g++ openjdk-14-jdk-headless . And build it with docker build -t ubuntu20-java14:latest . Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.56kB Step 1/5 : from ubuntu:focal ---&gt; 9140108b62dc ... Removing intermediate container 505236be00e4 ---&gt; 77a8c2ae4d16 Successfully built 77a8c2ae4d16 Successfully tagged ubuntu20-java14:latest . In our example’s case, we want to use this image as a base to build a buildfarm worker container image. Unfortunately, rules_docker does not know how to interact with the docker images hosted by a local docker daemon, only docker registries like dockerhub.io. We will get past this by running the local registry utility container. If you really want to host this base elsewhere, I’ll assume that you know how to translate the host:port references below, and you can skip running your own registry. First we need to tag our image so that it gets pushed to our local registry: . docker tag ubuntu20-java14:latest localhost.localdomain:5000/ubuntu20-java14:latest . Then we can start our registry with a recognizable name for later shutdown: . docker run -d --rm --name local-registry -p 5000:5000 registry . And push our newly tagged image: . docker push localhost.localdomain:5000/ubuntu20-java14:latest . Take note of the sha256:&lt;sha256sum&gt; output that was produced with this command, as we will need to use it to specify our base. Now we have a referent docker image that can be identified as a base to apply buildfarm’s worker installation onto. In a suitable location, create a WORKSPACE containing: . load(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\") BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_COMMIT = \"04fc2635f5546a4f5dc19dea35bb1fca5569ce24\" BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_SHA256 = \"f45215ef075c8aff230b737ca3bc5ba183c1137787fcbbb10dd407463f76edb6\" http_archive( name = \"build_buildfarm\", strip_prefix = \"bazel-buildfarm-%s\" % BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_COMMIT, sha256 = BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_SHA256, url = \"https://github.com/buildfarm/buildfarm/archive/%s.zip\" % BUILDFARM_EXTERNAL_COMMIT, ) load(\"@build_buildfarm//:deps.bzl\", \"buildfarm_dependencies\") buildfarm_dependencies() load(\"@build_buildfarm//:defs.bzl\", \"buildfarm_init\") buildfarm_init() load(\"@io_bazel_rules_docker//repositories:deps.bzl\", container_deps = \"deps\") load(\"@io_bazel_rules_docker//container:container.bzl\", \"container_pull\") container_deps() container_pull( name = \"ubuntu20_java14_image_base\", digest = \"sha256:&lt;sha256sum&gt;\", registry = \"localhost:5000\", repository = \"ubuntu20-java14\", ) . Be sure to substitute the sha256:&lt;sha256sum&gt; with your content from above. Next we will create a BUILD file to create our target image. We will use the shard variant here, but the memory worker (with supporting server execution) will work as well. The content of the BUILD file should be: . load(\"@io_bazel_rules_docker//java:image.bzl\", \"java_image\") java_image( name = \"buildfarm-shard-worker-ubuntu20-java14\", base = \"@ubuntu20_java14_image_base//image\", deps = [\"//src/main/java/build/buildfarm:buildfarm-shard-worker\"], main_class = \"build.buildfarm.worker.shard.Worker\", ) .

Superscalar stages have a configurable number of slots for their activity. Claims on these stages block until they are full, and have a number of slots to claim exclusively for activity. Match . The Match stage is responsible for dequeuing an operation from the Ready-To-Run queue. This operation is dequeued as a QueueEntry which contains the ExecuteEntry and a Digest for the transformed QueuedOperation. The ExecuteEntry contains a Platform definition which must match the worker’s provided platform manifest in order to proceed. A rejected QueueEntry for this reason will be reinserted into the Ready-To-Run queue. The Match stage is unique in that it claims a slot in the Input Fetch stage prior to its iteration. This removes a polling requirement for the active operation present in other stages while waiting to feed the interstage, reducing the stage’s complexity. Input Fetch . Input Fetch is a superscalar stage responsible for downloading the QueuedOperation from the CAS, and creating the execution directory for the Operation. This is the worker ingress bandwidth, and likely the disk IO write, consuming stage. Its configured concurrency is available in the worker config as input_fetch_stage_width. The ownership of output directories is configurable with [[exec_owner]]. Execution . Execution is a superscalar stage which initiates operation executions, applying any ExecutionPolicies. The operation transitions to the EXECUTING state when it reaches this stage. After spawning the process, it intercepts writes to stdout and stderr, and will terminate the process if it runs longer than its Action specified timeout. Its configured concurrency is available in the worker config as execute_stage_width. [[Execution Limiting]] is available as a configuration option under cgroups, if supported. Report Result . The Report Result stage injects any outputs from the operation into the CAS, and populates the ActionResult from from the results of the execution. It can inject into the ActionCache for cacheable actions, and can record an action in the blocklist if it violates output policy. The operation transitions to COMPLETED state after the outputs are recorded. After this stage is complete, the execution directory is destroyed, and the Operation exits the worker. ",

The realization of an operation’s execution root with the execution filesystem constitutes a transaction that the operating directory for an action will appear, be writable for outputs, and released and be made unavailable as it proceeds and exits the pipeline. This means that an action’s entire input directory must be available on a filesystem from a unique location per operation - the Operation Action Input Root, or just Root. Each input file within the Root must contain the content of the inputs, its requested executability via FileNode, and each directory must contain at the outset, child input files and directories. The filesystem is free to handle unspecified outputs as it sees fit, but the directory hierarchy of output files from the Root must be created before execution, and writable during it. When execution and observation of the outputs is completed, the exec filesystem will be asked to destroy the Root and release any associated resources from its retention. Choosing a filesystem storage type in the worker config as the first storage entry will select the CASFileCache CFCExecFileSystem.

Outputs of actions are physically streamed into CAS writes when they are observed after an action execution.
